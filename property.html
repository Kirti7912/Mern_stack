    <h1>Optimism</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Optimism is an <a href="#nowhere">attitude</a> reflecting a belief or hope that the outcome of some specific endeavor,
       or outcomes in general, will be positive, favorable, and desirable. A common idiom used to 
       illustrate optimism versus pessimism is a glass filled with water to the halfway point:
       an optimist is said to see the glass as half full, while a pessimist sees the glass as half empty.
    </p>
    <p>The term derives from the Latin optimum, meaning "best". To be optimistic, in the typical sense 
       of the word, is to expect the best possible outcome from any given situation.This is usually
       referred to in psychology as dispositional optimism. It reflects a belief that future conditions
        will work out for the best.[2] As a trait, it fosters resilience in the face of stress.

    <h3>Dispositional optimism</h3> 
    <p>Dispositional optimism and pessimism are typically assessed by asking people whether they expect
       future outcomes to be beneficial or negative. The LOT returns separate optimism and pessimism 
       scores for each individual.
    </p>
    <h3>Explanatory style</h3>
    <p>Explanatory style is distinct from dispositional theories of optimism. While related to
       life-orientation measures of optimism, attributional style[clarification needed] theory suggests
       that dispositional optimism and pessimism are reflections of the ways people explain events, i.e.,
       that attributions cause these dispositions.[19] An optimist would view defeat as temporary, as
       something that does not apply to other cases, and as something that is not their fault.
