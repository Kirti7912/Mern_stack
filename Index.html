    <p>A mother is a precious gift of God. A mother plays an important role in bringing a child to life.
       A mother is the support system of children. She takes care of her child and protects him from all
       the difficult situations. A mother is a form of God on the Earth who tries to fulfill all the needs
       and requirements of her child. A mother is an ocean of motherhood whose love and care for her children 
       never decreases. A mother does not need any sign to understand our needs. She can feel every pain,
       every gain, and every requirement just by seeing our eyes.</p>
